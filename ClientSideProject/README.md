Examples of web development projects

ClientSideProject was completed for a client-side scripting course that focused on using JavaScript, thats why all of the HTML elements are populated using JavaScript, as it was a requirement for the project. Same goes for the home page, as the prompt and population of the paragraph and header tags based on user entry were a specific requirement to show understanding of cookies. 

There is one notable bug that I did not fix in time to turn in the project, which is how the anchor tags move within the navigation bar as you click through the different pages. I believe it has something to do with how the nav bar is populated using an array and JavaScript. 

We were not able to use frameworks on this project, which is why Bootstrap was not used.
